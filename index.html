<p> Dogs are amazing animals but taking care of them is hard work. If you are looking to get a dog here are some tips. <br>

<br>TIP 1: Train them from the start. Dogs are intelligent animals that pick up on things very quickly but it's always best to start training them at early ages. Crate train them so when you go out you do not need to worry about them ruining things in the house. <br>
<br>TIP 2: Set a routine with specific timings. Dogs are <em>very</em> routined. Disorganization can create a stressful environment that may lead to anxiety and unwanted behaviors in your dog.<br>
<br>TIP 3: Physical and mental exercise are key. Walking your dog is good physical exercise, but it also provides mental stimulation. Some toys, such as puzzle toys, are also designed to offer mental exercise when your dog is indoors. </p>
